The following should allow you to start up and run this code sample.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keatonboyle/case-heatmap.git
cd case-heatmap
npm install
npm run server  # Starts a development server.  Not yet productionized.
```

Visit http://localhost:3000/case/buckley-v-valeo to see the result.

You should be able to add other case html and citation JSON files into appropriately-named directories underneath `assets/cases` and see the results.

NOTE: I didn't do much cross-browser testing, things look best on Chrome right now.
